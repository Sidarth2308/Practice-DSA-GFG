Given a sorted array, we need to find if there is a Pythagorean triplet in the array(A,B,C) such that A^2 + B^2 = C^2
I : 3 1 4 6 5
O : yes
    (3, 4, 5)

Solution : 
You follow 2 pointer approach but a modified version. You simply run 1 single outer loop. and then use the 2 pointer approach for all the elements between the next element and the end of the array (if going for a forward loop). Here you will need to run a reverse loop since the array is sorted and in A^2 + B^2 = C^2, C will be towards the end of the array.
