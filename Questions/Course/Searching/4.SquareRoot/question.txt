Find the square root of a number. If the square root is not perfect, then find the floor of it.
I : 4
O : 2

I : 14
O : 3

I : 25
O : 5

Solution : 
Use binary search to solve this.
Eg. if your number is X then you will have to try to find a number that is between 1 and X.
For this : 
We can use binary search to keep searching for values which are less then or greater than X/2 and then increase or decrease accordingly.
.       .       .
1       X/2     X


Whenever the square of mid is found to be less than than X then we will store this mid as a potential value and then eliminate left part like we do in binary search.
Why do we store this mid?
Because we need to return some value. So as we narrow down on the potential exact value, we also need to keep track of last found(best) value which satisfied (mid * mid < X).
Because since we need only floor, between 9-15 answer is only 3, between 16-24, answer is only 4, between 25-35, answer is only 5. Hence we keep track of last such value.
