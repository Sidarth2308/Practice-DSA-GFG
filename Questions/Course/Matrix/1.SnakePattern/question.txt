Given a matrix, print the elements in snake pattern:
I/P : 1  2  3  4
      5  6  7  8
      9  10 11 12
      13 14 15 16
O/P : 1 2 3 4 8 7 6 5 9 10 11 12 16 15 14 13


Solution : 
We use 2 nested loops. Outer loops follows the rows. Every time the now number is even, we move from left to right. Otherwise we more from right to left in the inner loop.
