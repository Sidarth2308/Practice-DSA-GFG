We are given an array and 3 variables : A,B,C. Elements from A-B are sorted and elements from B+1 - C are sorted. Sort the entire array.
Low <= Mid < High
I : 10, 15, 20, 11, 30
    low = 0
    mid = 2
    high = 4
O : [10, 11, 15, 20, 30]


Solution : 
Make 2 arrays of size mid-low+1 as array A and high-mid as array B.
Store the elements from low <= mid in A and mid+1 <= high in B.
Use the merge function of merge sort to merge the sorted arrays back into original.
