You are given 2 arrays of size n. One shows the arrival time of guests and the other tells their departure time.
You have to return the maximum possible guests you can meet simultaneously. This means that the maximum number of guests that will be available at the same time.
I : arrival : [900, 940]
    departure : [1000, 1030]
O : 2
Here we can meet both the guests if we go from 9:40 to 10:00.

I : arrival : [800, 700, 600, 500]
    departure : [840, 820, 830, 530]
O : 3
Here the max guests we can meet are 3. We can meet them if we go from 8:00 to 8:20.

I : arrival : [900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800]
    departure : [910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000]
O : 3

Here the max guests we can meet are 3. We can meet them if we go from 11:00 to 11:20

Solution : 
We will consider all the timelines, starting from first arrival to last departure and at every time we will see the guests available. Whatever is the max is out answer.
For eg. arrival : [900, 600, 700] and departure : [1000, 800, 730]
We will sort both the arrays:
arrival: [600, 700, 900] and departure : [730, 800, 1000]
After this lets imagine how this helps with the help of a table
Time    Action  Count
600     Arr     1
700     Arr     2
730     Dep     1
800     Dep     0
900     Arr     1
1000    Arr     0
In this table, we will just increase our guest count if there is an arrival and decrease if there is a departure. Through this we can see that the max guests that will be available simultaneously is 2.
After sorting, all we need to do is merge the two arrays according to their times. This is similar to merge function of merge sort.
