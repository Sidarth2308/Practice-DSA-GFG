You are given an array in which the elements represent the number of chocolates in a packet.
You have to distribute these chocolates to m children such that:
1) Each child should get exactly 1 packet. No more and no less
2) Minimize the difference between the minimum chocolates and the maximum chocolates that any two children get.
I : 7 3 2 4 9 12 56
    3
O : 2

What we mean here is that we need to distribute 3 packets only as each child can get only 1 packet. Now we need to find 3 packets here whose differences are are the least. If we pick eg. 9 12 and 56, we get a difference of 56-9 = 47. If we pick 7, 3, 2 we get a difference of 5.
If we pick 3,2,4, we get a difference of 2. This is the least difference hence we return this difference.

arr[m-1] - arr[0]
Solution : 
Sort the array and then assume that each element can be the smallest start. So then check for window of m-1 elements greater than it and simply do arr[m-1 +i] - arr[i]. Do this for all the elements and the pick the global minima.
