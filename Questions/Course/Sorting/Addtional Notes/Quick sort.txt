Quick sort 
1) Divide and conquer
2) Worst case : O(n^2)
3) despite worst case, it is considered faster because:
    a) In-place i.e. no need for aux array but still function call stack so arguable.
    b) Cache friendly
    c) Average case : O(nlogn)
    d) tail recursive
4) partition is key function

It revolves mainly around how you partition your array:
For stability:
Naive partition

Unstable but efficient partitioning algorithms:
Lomuto algorithm
Hoare algorithm



Considering Lomuto sort:
void qSort(arr, l, h){
    if(l<h){
        int p = partition(arr, l, h);
        qSort(arr, l, p-1);
        qSort(arr, p+1, h);
    }
}

For Hoare partition, just change p-1 to p.
This is done because hoare parition may or may not put the pivot in the right place.
Since Lomuto sort places the pivot at the right place, we can skip the call to sort it again.


Simple lomuto or hoare partition can be used to solve questions which involve 2 types of elements where they ask:
1) negative on one side and positive on the other
2) odd on one side and even on the other
3) sorting a binary array.
