Stability of sorting algorithm:
Stability means that if two values are same in our sorting condition check then they should appear in the same order as in the original array.
eg.
[
    ["Anil", 50],
    ["Ayan", 80],
    ["Piyush", 50],
    ["Ramesh", 80],
]
If we sort this array in the order of increasing marks then a stable algo 
will give the result:
[
    ["Anil", 50],
    ["Piyush", 50],
    ["Ayan", 80],
    ["Ramesh", 80],
]
Stability is important only if multivalued arrays neads to be sorted.

Example of Stable sorts:
Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort

Example of Non-Stable sorts:
Selection sort, Quick sort, Heap sort
